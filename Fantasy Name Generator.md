Fantasy Name Generator & Mixed Messages // A Codecademy Portfolio Project
=========================================================================

Scope:
------
#### Project-description by Codecademy:

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

### Project Objectives:
+ Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on your computer
#### Prerequisites:
+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command line


Idea:
-----

I started to build a Fantasy Name Generator with Java once to use it for character creation in a Pen&Paper Roleplaying Game.
Additional I want to combine this with a Mixed Message Generator, where the names will be used.

#### First Steps
1. Create arrays of sur- and last-Names //check
2. Create a randomizer function to combine a first name and a last name out of the according arrays //check
3. Create a function to create a random greeting message where the name is included //check

#### Extended Scope
4. Create a function to create a random name out of Syllables //check
5. Create a message where an input is required to choose if you want a more common (DnD-wise) or totally random name -> Message should be like "Greetings fellow traveler, pleace chose thy name"//check

That project was a lot of fun to create, I hope that you have fun using it. :-)
